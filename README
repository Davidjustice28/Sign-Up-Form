This is a project required by The Odin Project 

We were given a design with a general layout we were suppose to follow, however the assignment did encouraged students to put their own personal touches to the design. I chose to base the page around joining a program for basketball enthusiasts who are looking to find basketball tournaments to play in.

The form requires users to provide the following information:

- First & Last name
- Age
- Email address
- How many years theyâ€™ve been playing
- Favorite NBA team
